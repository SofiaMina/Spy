<h3> Why I liked the movie </h3>

<p> When I first watched this movie I thought it was really funny. I always liked the spy and undercover type of plot. This had that exciting mystery type plot but with a lot of
comedy. I almost couldn't go five minutes without laughing. The ways the characters interacted made everything funnier. Although some people call it a rip-off James Bond because
it had to much profanity and was not as realistic, but I disagree. It was just as interesting and is meant to comedy so I guess the profanity was kinda needed. 
I highly reccomend this movie.
