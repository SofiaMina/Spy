<p> This site is a plot summary and opinionated review on the movie Spy released in 2015. It it one of my favorite movies of 
all time that connects action and comedy. The website is split into three chapters. The first is a Introduction which introduces the plot and has a 
review from rotte tomatoes. It also introduces the two main characters and their relationship. The second chapter is a complete plot summary that 
doesn't go that in depth but gives a good runthrough of the movie. The last chapter is my opinionated chapter of why I specifically enjoyed the movie
and why I would reccomend it. I think this movie is the perfect blend of comedy and action and is the perfect movie to watch when stressed because it gives you a good laugh.
